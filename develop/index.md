This repository contains a collection of [BioWDL](https://github.com/biowdl)
workflows which can be used for aligning sequencing data. There is currently
one workflow available:
- [align-star.wdl](./align-star.html): Uses STAR to align RNA.

These workflows are part of [BioWDL](https://biowdl.github.io/)
developed by the SASC team at [Leiden University Medical Center](https://www.lumc.nl/).

## Dependency requirements and tool versions
These workflow can be run through [cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
and have been configured to automatically use docker containers if
the cromwell backend allows for this. All dependencies (besides cromwell) should,
therefore, automatically be obtained by cromwell.

Additionally, included in the repository is an `environment.yml` file. This file includes
all the tool versions on which the workflow was tested. You can use conda and
this file to create an environment with all the correct tools.
